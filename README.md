# Fuzzy-database

A compact fuzzy database was developed for the academic course 2021-2022 as part of the "Modelization" subject. The database was created using Prolog, a logic programming language, to facilitate the representation and manipulation of fuzzy data. This project aimed to demonstrate practical applications of fuzzy logic in modeling real-world scenarios.
